# bias-T
Two small  DC bias injector/extractor PCB's. The injector board has a holder for a 1A ATO fuse. All copper traces should handle 1.5 A.
The reason for the dual inductors is that in the event RF is present on the coax cable shield, the 100 uH inductor should stop it. All capacitors is ceramic SMD, 2KV. The diode protects against reverse polarity and voltage spikes generated by relay coils.

It should handle 1000 W RF from 160 meters to and including two meters.
